# 🧐 It's me! Ricardo! ✨

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RicardoGomesRocha/RicardoGomesRocha/main/images/banner.png)

🚀 So, here's the lowdown – I'm a full-stack web dev with a serious crush on front-end development. Armed with a master's in Software Engineering, I've been rocking the programming scene for a solid decade. I've got this knack for software architecture, team and project management, and even dabble in the magical realm of deep learning (yeah, AI, baby!).

My coding toolbox 🧰 is stacked – JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Angular, C#, SQL, NoSQL - you name it. Nevertheless, learning is my best tool 📚!

But here's the thing – I'm not just about the code. My soft skills game is strong – think big-picture pondering, critical thinking, and communication skills sharper than a ninja's blade. Leading, mentoring, and rocking successful projects? Yeah, that's my jam as well.

Now, outside the coding dojo, I'm a music lover. Saxophone and piano are my instruments of choice, teaching me the art of teamwork and staying cool under pressure.

I've got a soft spot for giving back too 🥰. I've lent a hand to the Jacksonville Human Society (dog shelter). And speaking of sharing wisdom, I also write blogs and buzz around on Twitter, LinkedIn, Stackoverflow and my own Blog. Go ahead and check me out:

Let's connect and dive into the exciting world of web development!

Cheers 🥂, Ricardo 👊
