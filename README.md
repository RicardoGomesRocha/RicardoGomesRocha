Hey there 👋!

🚀 So, here's the lowdown – As a Scrum Knight, I take on a hybrid role that blends the technical expertise of a Tech Lead with the agile facilitation skills of a Scrum Master. My mission is to ensure my team thrives both in implementing the Scrum framework and tackling technical challenges.

Here’s how I approach this role:
- ✅ Implement Scrum: Ensure the team fully embraces and follows the Scrum framework.
- 🤝 Self-Organization & Collaboration: Guide the team to become self-organized, cross-functional, and highly collaborative.
- 🛠️ Technical Empowerment: Ensure the team has the technical skills and tools needed to excel in their roles.
- 👩‍💻 Hands-On Leadership: Actively code alongside the team while mentoring them on technical decisions.
- 🌱 Psychological Safety: Foster an environment where collaboration thrives, mistakes are seen as learning opportunities, and innovation is encouraged.
